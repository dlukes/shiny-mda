# Bookmarking

Fix bookmarking functionality. Perhaps the only thing that's needed is to get
rid of the initial error...? â†’ It's not.

# DataTables

Maybe rewrite table coloring and other styling options, which are now in
`loadingsTable.js`, using the formatting helper functions in the `DT`
library...? (See [here](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/functions.html)).

(Though on the other hand, I might have to cycle repeatedly through the rows
in order to apply various different options controlled by different functions,
whereas with the callback, it's done in just one pass.)

See if built-in datatable column range filters can be made to filter outer
ranges instead of inner ranges.
