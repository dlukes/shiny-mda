Put the DIVISION tick boxes in the same order they're in the plot legend.
Basically, I should just reorder the levels of the DIVISION factor and change
the labels instead of creating an additional factor and messing things up.

Fix bookmarking functionality (perhaps the only thing that's needed is to get
rid of the initial error...).
